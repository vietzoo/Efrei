1. What is this code about?
	The code is a shop in game where gilded is selling items. Some items can expire during time, and also their quality are variable.
	We might be able to implement features that will let us sell new items and also bring new functionnabilities to items.

2. Can you clearly identify the name of all the goods stored in the Guilded Rose?
	Yes we can see them properly in program.cs :
    - "+5 Dexterity Vest"
    - "Aged Brie"
    - "Elixir of the Mongoose"
    - "Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros"
    - "Backstage passes to a TAFKAL80ETC concert"
    - "Conjured Mana Cake"

3. What happens when the day is over?
    It will depend on the item, for the quality :
    - The Vest and Elixir will lose 1 quality point.
    - Aged Brie and Backstage will increase their quality by 1.
    - Sulfuras is a legendary item so it's quality wont change.
    - Conjured Mana will decrease by twice as fast as the normal items.
    As for the expiration date :
    - Sulfuras is a legendary item so it won't impact it
    - Every items will go lose 1 on their expiration date.

4. What happens to cheese when the day is over?
    
5. What happens when a concert ticket goes over its expiration day?
    The quality of the item will drop to 0.

6. What makes this code hard to read?
    How the functions are implemented and also the variables and classes make the code hard to read.

7. Do you think the rules are clear enough so that you could rework the entire solution from scratch?
    I think the rules are fine to code a solution from scratch.

Part 2 Test : What is the benefit of adding tests here?
    This is good to see if the base code is working properly.
